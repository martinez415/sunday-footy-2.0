# Sunday Footy
Sunday Footy is a user-friendly sports statistic website that provides comprehensive data on the domestic performance of teams competing across five major American and European Football leagues. 
## Pain Point
Sports statistics websites contain detailed information regarding clubs, international competitions, individual players, and more. Oftentimes, these sites have a dense User Interface to accommodate all this data. An example of this is charts and tables that are difficult to parse. Sunday Footy utilizes simple design elements, such as forms and tables, to provide data in an accessible way. 
## User Stories 
* As a user, I want to easily navigate a website to search for a major league and select my favorite team. 
* As a user, I want to see relevant information regarding my team's league performance. 
## Upcoming Features
I will continue working on this project to include data on individual players.
